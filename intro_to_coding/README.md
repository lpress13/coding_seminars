# Intro to Coding

For our first seminar, we're going to start with an intro to coding for non-developers.  If you are a data scientist who always gets code to work but wish you knew more about how you got there, this is for you.  If you spend your time in customer-facing responsibilities and wish you knew more about coding, this is for you.  If you are Hegele... you probably already have this covered.  We can chat.

Starting on November 15th, we're going to meet from 3:00-4:30 pm, once every two weeks.  There will be six total sessions, and each session will be organized around some real-world coding task.  Each session will have homework that takes that real-world task and asks you to solve a more complicated version of it.

In the off-weeks, we'll have office hours at the same time, where anyone working on the homework can get together and we'll help each other with any hangups.  We're also being serious about this, so you'll have to commit to attending every session and doing the homework.  We'll record the sessions if you just can't make it, but if you don't have time to finish the homework, we'll ask you to step out of the rotation and start up again with the next series if you're interested.  

Honestly, I'm going to ask a lot of questions about pace and content along the way, but here's a quick guess at what we'll cover:

DAY 1

* Iterative design
* Methods
* Common data structures

DAY 2

* Git (part 1) - add, commit
* Object-oriented programming

DAY 3

* Git (part 2) - push, pull, clone
* Test-driven development

DAY 4

* Regular expressions
* Reading from files?

DAY 5

* Relational and normalized databases
* Database design

DAY 6

* SQL
* Object-relational mappers (ActiveRecord)

DAY 7

* Git (part 3) - branches
* The Web
* APIs

This class will be taught in Ruby.  Future classes will probably be more topical, covering things like Machine Learning, other data stores, or other languages.
