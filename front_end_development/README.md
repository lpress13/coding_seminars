# Front-end Development

This class is geared towards both developers *and* non developers. We'll cover a wide range of topics related to front-end development. If you're interested in learning more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end development in general, then join us!

We'll meet once every two weeks, for an hour and a half. I'll have office hours in between classes.

## Pre-requisites

Come prepared to do a homework assignment for each class. You should have the following installed on your laptop:

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* a text editor (like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), or [Atom](https://atom.io/)).

You'll also want to have a [github](https://github.com/) account.

I'm happy to help with getting your machine setup either before class starts, or during the first week of class. If installing node or git sounds overwhelming, don't worry, I'll walk you through it.
