# Front-end Development

This class is geared towards both developers *and* non developers. We'll cover a wide range of topics related to front-end development. If you're interested in learning more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end development in general, then join us!

We'll meet once every two weeks, for an hour and a half. I'll have office hours in between classes.

## Pre-requisites
